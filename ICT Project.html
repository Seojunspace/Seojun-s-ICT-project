        <h2>Gender bias is undermining our social fabric and devalues all of us. It is not just a human rights issue; it is a tremendous waste of the world’s human potential. By denying women equal rights, we deny half the population a chance to live life at its fullest. Political, economic and social equality for women will benefit all the world’s citizens. Together we can eradicate prejudice and work for equal rights and respect for all.</h2>

           <h1>What can we do?</h1></center><br>
           <ul>
            
            <h3><li>Women earn 10 to 30 per cent less than men for the same work. Pay inequality persists everywhere. Voice your support for equal pay for equal work.</li>
            <li>Be aware of gender stereotypes. Recognize them, avoid them and educate others about them.</li>
            <li>Find a Goal 5 charity you want to support. Any donation, big or small, can make a difference!</li>
            <li>Stand up against harassment. Whenever you see or become aware of harassment, whether in the workplace, streets, home or the online space, raise your voice against it.</li>
            <li>Share the workload at home. Sharing domestic responsibilities ensures the work burden doesn’t fall only on one person and instills the value of gender equality and essential life skills in children.</li>
            <li>Find female mentors/leaders. Ensure that some of your role models or mentors are women. There’s a lot you can learn from women in positions of authority.</li></h3>
        </ul>
